# Solving the age old problem
**where** do you eat? Surely you have had this fight with a significant other when neither of you can agree on what you would like to eat. If you can't decide on a usual spot, this may be for you!

I ventured to see what GraphQL has to offer. It seemed like it would be a possibly better OData? When I heard an arguement between two friends on where to eat, I spouted "why not check Yelp?". After a quick search, I found a GraphQL endpoint was in beta and set off to see what Blazor has to offer when trying to interact with it like a SPA framework. 

I ended up using the GraphQL nuget package, but would like to look at the Strawberry Cake packoge some time in the future.
